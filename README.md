# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to utiliza semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)


The general format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg, 1.0.1

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes


## Install Terraform CLI

Considerations with the terraform CLI changes
The terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to gpg keyring changes. So we needed refer to the lastesr install CLI instructions via Terraform Documentation and change the scripting for install.

### Considerations for Linux distribution

This project is built against Ubuntu.
Please consider checking your distribution needs.

Example of OS checking information

```sh
$ cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues we notice that bash scripts steps were a considerable amount more code. So we decided to creare a bash script to install the Terraform CLI.

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This allow us an easier to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install.
- This will allow better portablity for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.

####  Shebang Considerations

A Shebangs (prounced Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program that will interpret the script. eg. `#!/bin/env bash`

ChatGPC recpmmended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS distributions.
- will search the userÂ´s PATH for the bash executable

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

####Execution Considerations

When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notiation to execute the bash script.

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yaml we need to poiny the script to a program to interpert it.
eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli`


####Linux Considerations

In order to make our bash scripts executable we need to change permission for the fix to be exetuable at the user mode.

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

Alternatively :
```sh
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### GitHub Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using the Init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace
